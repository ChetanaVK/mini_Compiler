# Mini Compiler for the C++ programming language

Project Aim: To design a Mini Compiler for the C++ programming language which focuses on generating an optimized intermediate code for the C++ source code having specific constructs.

Works for constructs such as conditional statements, loops and ternary operator.

Implementation is done in C++.

Steps involved:
- Generate symbol table
- Generate Abstract Syntax Tree for the code
- Generate 3 address code
- Perform Code Optimization 

Main tools used in the project include:
- LEX which identifies predefined patterns and generates tokens for the patterns matched 
- YACC which parses the input for semantic meaning and generates an abstract syntax tree and intermediate code for the source code.
- PYTHON is used to optimize the intermediate code generated by the parser.
